# Instructions to install \& run MongoDB using docker 
To make database presistant, docker recommends to use volumes.

> Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers (![Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/))

The following command needs to be run only one time to create volumen to store database data:

`docker volume create --name=mongodata`

Now, to run MongoDB using docker, everytime you need to use the following command:

`docker run --name mongodb -v mongodata:/data/db -d -p 27017:27017 mongo`

The above command will install mongo image if it is unable to find it locally. It also sets up the volume created in previous command and exposes the port locally to use the database.
